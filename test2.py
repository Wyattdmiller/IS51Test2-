""" Structured English
This program will open the file Final.txt, which contains student grades on a final exam.
It will then create a list, where each item of the list is a line of the file.
It will display the number of items in the list, which is the number of grades.
It will then sum the grades in the list, and divide the sum by the number of grades to get an average.
It will display the average.
Then it will check each grade in the list and compare it to the average. 
It will keep track of how many grades were above the average,
and display that number as a percentage of the number of grades.
